## Usage
#### Navigate to program directory

#### Run the program

The program will prompt the user for two positive integer numbers: the number of rows and the number of seats in each row. The ticket price is determined by the following rules:
<br><br>
If the total number of seats in the screen room is not more than 60, then the price of each ticket is 10 dollars.
<br><br>
In a larger room, the tickets are 10 dollars for the front half of the rows and 8 dollars for the back half. Please note that the number of rows can be odd, for example, 9 rows. In this case, the first half is the first 4 rows, and the second half is the other 5 rows.
<br><br>
When the item Statistics is chosen, your program should print relevant business data.
